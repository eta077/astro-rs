# astro-rs
Inspired by Astropy (http://astropy.org / https://github.com/astropy/astropy)

# Goals
## General goals
* Achieve feature compatibility with the Astropy library
* Equal or surpass the Astropy benchmarks

## Technical goals
* Deserialize as lazily as possible
* Balance 'tight' (https://www.ecorax.net/tightness) types and adherance to the FITS API with graceful handling of deviation

# Testing
Test assets are from https://esahubble.org/projects/fits_liberator/datasets_archives
